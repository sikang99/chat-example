<h1 class="page-title">Terms &amp; Privacy policy</h1>

<h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
<p>Niltalk does not collect or store any sort of information from its users on disk&mdash;no IP addresses, chat messages, or nick names.
Chat messages from users pass through Niltalk to other users without undergoing any form of logging or caching. Chatroom IDs, nicknames, and passwords (bcrypt hashed) are held in the memory
(RAM) transiently for the life of a chatroom. This information is flushed on manual disposal or after {{ .Config.RoomTimeout }} seconds of inactivity (no messages exchanged).</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
All communication happens over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=niltalk.com">SSL (SHA256+RSA)</a>.


<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on the user's computer. Niltalk may set and retrieve session cookies. 
The session cookies do not contain any personally identifiable data but randomly generated session tokens to keep the user
logged in during the lifetime of a chatroom. They are also short lived&mdash;a browser restart flushes them.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Niltalk and its services are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, either expresses or implied. In no event shall
Niltalk, its proprietor or its contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or 
consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; 
or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, 
or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the 
possibility of such damage.</p>


<h2>No guarantees or warranties</h2>
