This is a demo of a simple web chat app using golang and websockets.

This requires the go websocket package, to get the package

<code>go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket</code>

To get the files for this example app

<code>go get github.com/domluna/websocket-golang-chat

<code>go install</code>

Note that in order to call the binary from any folder you have to change the path in line 17 to

<code>"PATH_TO_FOLDER/websocket-golang-chat/chat.html"</code>

If your not going to need to call it from anywhere but the current folder then dont do anything.
